<p>
  The main parts of our element are as follows:
  <br>

<ol>

  <li>
    <b>The opening tag:</b>
    This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
    opening and closing <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element
    begins or
    starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
  </li>

  <li><b> The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that
    it includes a<i> forward slash</i> before the element name. This states
    where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to
    add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to
    strange results.
  </li>
  <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this
    case, is just text.</li>
  <li><b>The element:</b>The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content
    together comprise the element.</li>
</ol>
